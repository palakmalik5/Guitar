            <p>Description: This are one of several Squier models available that offer a pretty good product for a reasonably low
            price. The pick-ups and hardware are sometimes suspect, and the workmanship varies from instrument to instrument, but
            for the price, these are a very good beginner guitar choice.<br> <br>

            Customer Reviews: Hmm...well, sounds like a tele at low volumes...the higher the volume, the worse the squeals;like a
            pig really...ah well, it's a cheap guitar...also tends to rattle above the 10th fret; on the 1st and 2nd strings (to the
            point of fretting out completely); and on the 5 and 6 stings on the 1st through 3rd frets...weird...action; settings
            help, but not much...hard to set the intonation as well (read, damn near impossible)...</p> <br> <br>

            <p>Description: Modelled after the much more expensive Gibson SG guitars, the Epiphone SG G310 keeps it's cost low by using
            cheaper hardware and lower quality humbucking pick-ups. The G-310 features an alder body, a mahogany neck, and a
            dot-inlayed rosewood fingerboard. <br> <br>

            Customer Reviews: Heck...I bought it as a knock around guitar I could beat up a little as I carried it around with me;
            (I hate not having a guitar next to me...)...but it hasn't even fit this role very well;I considered putting in new
            pickups and tuners...but the whole buzzing thing seems impossible to cure;well, there you go...I'm planning to sell it,
            or failing that; when my new band plays our first show I guess I'll pull a Townsend on it...</p> <br> <br>

            <p>Description: Here's another guitar many people feel is a great value. This Pacifica features an agathis body, maple neck, and
            rosewood fretboard, with two single coil pick-ups, and one humbucker. The consensus is the guitar is reasonably well
            made, and the quality of the wood tends to be high. <br> <br>

                Customer Reviews: yep...those were the pros above...basically this guitar;I guess it might be okay if you need something that looks and
                feels like a guitar;hmm...well, hit it hard and it chips...no finish flaws though;the tuners suck so bad it's hard to
                describe...tuning it is a real pain...but it doesn't go out too quickly I guess... ; just to practice on if you don't
                care what it sounds like at all...</p> <br> <br>

                Customer Reviews: It's got a fatter sound to it than a standard strat for obvious reasons.; I only have a couple complaints. First of all,
                there's a slight buzzing problem on the sixth string; especially if you're not pressing hard. Also, the strings that
                came on it were very low quality; On several strings I couldn't even get a note below the 12th fret; but I put Elixirs
                on it and that's fixed.</p> <br> <br>

            <p>Description:The Les Paul is perhaps the most famous guitar in rock and roll. Epiphone has done a good job of visually
            re-creating the Les Paul in this lower-cost guitar marketed towards beginners. The Special II features a laminated
            alder/maple body, a magogany neck, rosewood fingerboard, and two open-coil humbucking pick-ups.<br> <br>

                Customer Reviews: Nice tone with use of quality strings, highs are clear and lows are decent; in depth considering this really is a
                beginner's guitar; Set up must be with quality strings. No apparent flaws, guitar now 11 years old and still sounds
                great; Finish is still impeccable. I'm really surprised as I did not expect it to last this long; No apparent flaws,
